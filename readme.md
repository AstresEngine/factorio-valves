Overflow, top-up and one-way(check) valves, just like Flow Control and Advanced Fluid Handling. The thresholds can be configured using shortcuts.

This is based on the techniques used in [Configurable Valves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/configurable-valves).

# Shortcuts (configurable)
- **Numpad +**: Increase threshold for overflow or top-up valves.
- **Numpad -**: Increase threshold for overflow or top-up valves.

# Compatibility

Should be comptatibile with most mods. If it's not compatible, please let me know.
    - **Pyanodons**: Will automatically migrate old Factorio 1.1 valves to their 2.0 counter part.

# Known bugs
- There is some weird fluidbox arrows being drawn at the moment. This is awaiting API changes to fix.
